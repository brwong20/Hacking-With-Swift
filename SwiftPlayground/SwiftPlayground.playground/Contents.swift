/* Two frequent uses of implicity unwrapped optionals
 
 1. Apple's APIs or other external frameworks you have no control over
 
 2. Working with UIKit elements - We can rely on storyboards and ourselves to always initialize these elements before the compiler catches them. If not, the compiler will throw a VERY CLEAR error as to why we haven't initialized them yet.

 3. When you have a property you KNOW will be populated during initializtion or shortly after. (e.g. init method, or a method called after init like awakeFromNib() when we are able to get properties of the UI element)
 
 **ANY OTHER INSTANCE, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS OPT FOR OPTIONALS OR SOMETHING ELSE!!!

//CLASSES//

/* Similar syntax to structs, but have a number of difference in Swift:
    
 1.You don't get an automatic memberwise initializer for your classes; you need to write your own.
 2.You can define a class as being based off another class, adding any new things you want.
 3.If you copy an object, both copies point at the same data by default.
 
*/

        1. Make properties optionals - Ugly
        
        2. Set default values - Ok solution
 
        3. Create a custom constructor which guarantees properties will be set - BEST
 
    */

    var age: Int

    }
    
    //Note: A function INSIDE a class is called a method!
    func sing() {
        print("La la la la")
    }
}


//Inheritance

class CountrySinger: Singer {
    var noiseLevel: Int
    
    //Swift has a particular way of adding derived class properties: We have to create a custom init method which will set the non-optional properties of the derived class AS WELL AS the base class!
    init(name: String, age: Int, noiseLevel: Int) {
        self.noiseLevel = noiseLevel
        super.init(name: name, age: age)//ALL super calls must be made AFTER we've initialized all our non-optional properties! (The super usually comes first in other languages)

        print("Trucks, guitars, and liquor")

//When to use structs vs classes?! - VALUE VS REFERENCE

/*
 When you copy a struct, the whole thing is duplicated, including all its values. This means that changing one copy of a struct doesn't change the other copies â€“ they are all INDIVIDUAL. With classes, each copy of an object points at the same original object, so if you change one THEY ALL CHANGE. Swift calls structs "value types" because they just point at a value, and classes "reference types" because objects are just shared references to the real value.
 
 This is an important difference, and it means the choice between structs and classes is an important one:
 
 If you want to have one SHARED STATE that gets passed around and modified in place, you're looking for CLASSES. You can pass them into functions or store them in arrays, modify them in there, and have that change reflected in the rest of your program.
 
 If you want to AVOID shared state where one copy can't affect all the others, you're looking for STRUCTS. You can pass them into functions or store them in arrays, modify them in there, and they won't change wherever else they are referenced.
 
 If I were to summarize this key difference between structs and classes, I'd say this: classes offer more flexibility, whereas structs offer more safety. As a BASIC RULE, you should always use structs until you have a specific reason to use classes.

 Public: this means everyone can read and write the property.
 
 Internal: this means only your Swift code can read and write the property. If you ship your code as a framework for others to use, they wonâ€™t be able to read the property.
 
 File Private: this means that only Swift code in the same file as the type can read and write the property.
 
 Private: this is the most restrictive option, and means the property is available only inside methods that belong to the type.

//An example of a closure being useful here is that the animate() requires UIKit to do some setup work before antimating a view. With the closure, the method can take a copy of our chunk of code we want to run (closure) and run it after it has finished setting up. This wouldn't be possible if we just ran our code directly with the method if it was possible.

//Trailing closures: Methods w/ closures as their last argument have the option of using this syntatctic sugar. Should always use this for easier readibility!
